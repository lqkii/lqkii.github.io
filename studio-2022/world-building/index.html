            "I wanted to make something kind." - ONE [Author of One Punch Man and Mob Psycho 100] (paraphrased since I can't find the source of the interview)

The most hyped up second season since My Hero Academia II has come to fruition and let me say, it does not disappoint.
<br>
<br>
My expectations were sky-hecking-high after an incredible first season. Yet, SOMEHOW, the second season went above and beyond the call of duty and blew me away with the most amazing season of any show I have ever seen in my life. Allow me to explain.
<br>
<br>
While most people's complaints related to the show is "bland" and "too slice-of-life". I must first say that this show is centered around the characters rather than the plot, despite the plot being really, really good.
<br>
<br>
Nothing related to the story is wasted. Every character, every line, every moment, every sound, camera angle, power, you name it, is important. There wasn't a single episode that I felt that I was sold short. I ate up every moment, because it MATTERED.
<br>
<br>
While small things like incredible animation, directing, pacing, humor, romantization of normal occurrences and all other terms I could use to show how great the show is despite 90% of the population not knowing what that means, I want to focus on the main part of the series I love the most.
<br>
<br>
The characters. Every single one of them feels like a fragment of a real person's soul, and shaped to become a well rounded character. Reigen, Mob, Teru, Ritsu, Suzuki, Shou, CLAW, new villains, side villains, and school kids, are all important characters. I was constantly surprised and satisfied with how real these characters felt and reacted to their situations. Their motivations were understandable, and frighteningly relatable.
<br>
<br>
The relationships between these characters are even more fascinating and is what brings me to tears a majority of the time.
<br>
<br>
The psychology of this show blows my mind, and saying that it has taught me how I think is flawed (by showing characters that mirror my way of thinking) and how life is actually beautiful (albeit being kind of awful sometimes) would NOT be an understatement.
<br>
<br>
Mob Psycho 100 is my favorite form of entertainment on all platforms for probably the rest of my life. I would not hesitate to recommend this anime to other people, knowing that many people will probably miss the point of the whole show, which is this:
<br>
<br>
You matter. Relationships matter. Living life joyfully and working hard, even as a everyday commoner, is not something to be ashamed of, but to be cherished. Enjoy yourself, your life, and your relationships. A message needing to be heard by every human being.
