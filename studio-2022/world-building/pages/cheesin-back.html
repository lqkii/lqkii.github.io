                Yeah, you wear a disguise
                <br>    
                Yeah, you're so hard to find
                <br>    
                So make up your mind, baby
                <br>
                I don't need no more maybes
                <br>    
                And I tried to call you last night
                <br>    
                All my friends said, "Stop"

                Well it's not the same in the morning
                <br>
                I'm picking up signs that you're leavin'
                <br>    
                But we're deep in, so it depends
                <br>    
                If this is how you want me then I am yours
                <br>
                Just another body calling my over
                <br>    
                <br>
                I don't know what you want me to say
                <br>    
                It's been so long
                <br>    
                That I'm feeling this way
                <br>
                In your arms is my favorite place
                <br>
                Can we talk I want you to stay

                I thought that everything was changing
                <br>
                I loved the life that we were making
                <br>
                It's not a walk in the park if I trip in the dark
                <br> 
                It's a sign of the times and it's hard
                <br>
                <br>
                I've been knowing that we can't last
