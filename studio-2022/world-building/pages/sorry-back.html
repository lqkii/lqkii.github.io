            <br>
            And I just wanna feel done despite
            <br>
            That I know that you really want
            <br> 
            To be alone all the time
            <br>
            <br>
            So wait for a better thing to come tonight
            <br>
            And you won't have to see me with those eyes
            <br>
            But all i ever really wanted was to have a life
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="text-style" id="text-right">
            Whenever you see
            <br>
            I'll be there
            <br>    
            Whatever you want
            <br>    
            I'll steal it
            <br>   
            Whenever you want
            <br>    
            I'll try to be it all
            <br>    
            But there's nothing I won't do for you
            <br>    
            And I know I'm not
            <br>    
            And I'll tear it all
            <br>   
            For the chance to feel
            <br>    
            Like it could've meant the world to me
            <br>    
            And every time I have to hear you speak
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="highlight" id="text-right-2">    
            I can't ever help but always think
            <br>
            How I see the worst in all of me
            <br>
            All of me

            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="text-style">
            If I really tried to have run from it
            <br>
            Then I know that it would've been my S.O.S
            <br>    
            But even if I did would you really check
            <br>    
            Or try to tell me that it's always for the best
            <br>
            <br>
            So I'm tryna breathe for you
            <br>    
            Whenever you want me to
            <br>    
            Whatever you ask of me I'll do
            <br>    
            Cause I know that it'll mean the world to you
            <br>
            And I know now that it's vacant
            <br>
            And you tell me
            <br>
            You can help me stop feeling empty
            <br>
            If you tell me you're sorry
            <br>
            And you miss me
            <br>
            But I don't think you've ever met me
            <br>
            And you tell me you love me and to keep
            <br>
            [?] next to me
            <br>
            But you don't ever want me to believe
            <br>
            That  you're all alone ooohhhhh
