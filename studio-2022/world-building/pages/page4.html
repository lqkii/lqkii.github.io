            Down to the last two
            <br>
            I let it down and through
            <br>
            You’re telling me to rely on you
            <br>
            The antecedent of
            <br>
            What came when we were young
            <br>
            Another being done to go in you
            <br>
            <br>
            I didn’t think that you’d come back but I can’t hold it
            <br>
            Whenever You tried to cut this off well I can’t show it
            <br>
            When you would call the odds away
            <br>
            Well I’d try to live through you
            <br>
            But I can’t say I didn’t mean it too
            <br><br>
            I’m so tired of this
            <br>
            But I can’t find it in
            <br>
            For Us to tromper le monde
            <br>
            So we could get along
            <br>
            <br>
            But in the span to reach the second volley
            <br>
            Well I saw the intеntion to harm me
            <br>
            You’re trying to buy your time right off mе
            <br>
            And cut the message you have brought me
            <br>
            <br>
            You put a grip on my submission
            <br>
            You pulling my weight through cognition
            <br>
            But whatever you do don’t tell me
            <br>
            I’m failing you
            <br>
            <br>
            I didn’t think that you’d come back but I can’t hold it
            <br>
            Whenever You tried to cut this off well I can’t show it
            <br>
            When you would call the odds away
            <br>
            Well I’d try to live through you
            <br>
            But I can’t say I didn’t mean it too
            <br>
            <br>
            You say your under this
            <br>
            But you don’t know what you mean
            <br>
            For the time is all we got
            <br>
            And you think you’ve got me
            <br>
            <br>
            I’ve begun to know
            <br>
            And I see you really are
            <br>
            Scared and all alone
            <br>
            Behind this built mirage
            <br>
            <br>
            And I know that we both are are aging
            <br>
            And trying to fit in
            <br>
            A new replacement
            <br>
            For what we were then
            <br>
            But honey we’re dying
            <br>
            Before we are living
            <br>
            So let’s let this go</p>
