        <p class="body-text">
            [Verse 1]
            <br>
Hon, please forgive me if I ever did you wrong
<br>
I'll be your candle; burn me upside down
<br>
From now on, I won't sleep on my arms
<br>
Numb, is how I feel deep inside my soul
<br>
Need to feel that I am on the line
<br>
I'm sorry that I dragged you down my way
<br>
<br>

[Verse 2]
<br>
Hon, I never meant to cheat you out of time
<br>
In cold mornings when our sheets are warm
<br>
I see a flower with no needles on (So far)
<br>
Stung, and there's a bee that gave it all away
<br>
Pretty eyes now filled with pain
<br>
A young confusion, what a shame
