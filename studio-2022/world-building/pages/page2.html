            I think I tried too hard
Whenever we would speak
I’m falling in the gaps
That we left in between
<br>
<br>
I don’t know if I could ever come to listen
But I got a feeling that you’ll be persistent
I’m awake when you’re all in the room
But I don’t know if I’m really with you
<br>
<br>
When I wanted to react I waste away
And I don’t know if I can act accordingly
And if I had another chance I’d take my time
But I just wouldn’t show you how I am
Inside
<br>
<br>
I just want to say
When you look at me
I’ll break for you then
Where I will wait
All my life
<br>
<br>
It’s just a moment where you feel secure
But it’s a moment where I feel the most
And I could say that it’s my time to go
But I just wish that it was like before
Well it could just been then where it’s at your best
And left in the past with your regrets
Well I guess I’ll just be a goner then
And if I could go back I would live
<br>
<br>
Well I’d tried to stay but I don’t know where to start
When I’d awake and it would all fall apart
I’ve been here when it was getting too dark
And if you’d say I’d go wherever you are
<br>
<br>
But if you want it just take it
Cause I wouldn’t change it
And if you could stop it
Would you just have me
Fall In to pieces
Whenever you need it
Cause I don’t wanna wait
For you to leave
<br>
<br>
When I wanted to react I waste away
And I don’t know if I can act accordingly
And if I had another chance I’d take my time
But I just wouldn’t show you how I am
Inside
<br>
<br>
I just want to say
When you look at me
I’ll break for you then
Where I will wait
All my life</p>
