            FAKEOUT
            <br>
            <br>
            Fakeout—an ability that currently directionally mimics the sound of Yoru’s footsteps to mislead enemies—is now a full copy of Yoru, that runs forward, and when damaged, explodes and debuffs enemies.
            <br>
            <br>
            As added flavor, when the copy is shot, it faces the direction of the person that fired the shot and flashes towards their position in a conal direction. A change like this requires the most in terms of new art, so we explored how to visualize these changes early on. We expect you have some questions:
            <br>
            <br>
            GATECRASH
            <br>
            <br>
            Not much has changed with this one since the last post, aside from the team creating the additional art elements needed to bring this portion of Yoru’s update to life. The big thing here is the “puddle” left on the ground after a fake teleport. While the goal of the fake teleport is to create confusion about Yoru’s location, you should be able to go to where the fake teleport occurred, and then understand whether the real Yoru is around, or was it a misdirection?
            <br>
            <br>
            DIMENSIONAL DRIFT
            <br>
            <br>
            OK, prepare for a text dump. Here’s a summary of the changes during Yoru’s ult:
            <br>
            <br>
            Yoru is no longer revealed to enemies
            Yoru is able to cast all utility while in Dimensional Drift
            Enemies can hear Yoru’s footsteps
            Nearsighted is removed
            Unequip delay time is increased slightly
            Cast delay added when casting Dimensional Drift, preventing the invulnerability frame on cast.
            So what were the goals here?
            <br>
            <br>
            When looking at updating Yoru’s ultimate, we wanted to fix some of the unintended play patterns that have shown up in-game, and instead give Yoru the tools to gain ground on enemies using stealth and initiate the rest of his team to follow.
            <br>
            <br>
            Reducing the amount of time he can stay invisible should also stop the “invincible” Yoru from simply dancing in his enemy’s face. The new unequip time is meant to hinder the combo of blasting Shorty right after switching to visible. An added delay to his invulnerability stops Yoru from relying too much on running around with his mask in his hand and jamming it on at the first sight of danger.
            <br>
            <br>
            Instead, Yoru can now see the battlefield unhindered, allowing him to enter enemy zones, take in the state of the map and mastermind a play— based around Yoru’s change that allows abilities during his ult.
            <br>
            <br>
            Imagine a Yoru that can send teleporters into new places—deep behind enemy lines, place flashes to move enemies off angles for his team, or possibly land the perfect blind to mask his “de-stealth” and claim a frag. We think this update unlocks a lot of new possibilities for a Drifting Yoru, and we hope that it helps bring some of his fantasy of stealth infiltration to life.
