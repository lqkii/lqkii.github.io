                    <h2 class="headings">Using Baking Soda</h2>
                <h4 class="bodies">
                    We all know that baking soda helps pastries rise and get fluffy, but it's also an amazing meat tenderizer. The process of marinating meat with baking soda is known as velveting because it makes the meat tender and juicy.
            
                    It alkalizes the surface of the meat, which prevents the protein strands from binding to each other and helps it retain water. Without it, the meat can dry out quickly and become tough.
                    
                    If you don't want to use baking soda, you can always physically tenderize the meat with a mallet.

                <h2 class="headings">Tamari</h2>
                <h4 class="bodies">
                    Here, we're using tamari, which is interchangeable with dark soy sauce. They both have a subtle sweetness and are often used to give food a slightly darker color.
        
                    Tamari is the OG Japanese soy sauce as its recipe is the closest to the soy sauce that was originally introduced to Japan from China.
                    
                    It contains little or no wheat so it's a perfect alternative for anyone out there that's gluten intolerant. It's mainly made in the Chubu region of Japan and it's a great alternative to dark soy sauce.

        <h2 class="headings">Instructions</h2>
        <ol class="bodies">
            <li>Cut your flank steak (5 oz) into medium or 1/4 inch slices. Once cut, put the meat into a room-temperature water bath to rinse out the myoglobin. This helps be beef to cook and taste better.</li>
            <li>Peel and thinly slice the yellow onion (0.25) into 1/4 inch thickness.

                Wash the bean sprouts (0.50 handful), drain, and set aside.
                
                Wash and chop the green onions (1.5 stems) into 1 inch long pieces. Use all of the green onions and separate the white parts from the green parts.</li>
            <li>Create beef marinade: Mix the baking soda (0.50 tsp), cornstarch (0.50 tbsp), oyster sauce (0.50 tbsp), soy sauce (0.50 tbsp), tamari (0.50 tsp), white pepper (0.13 tsp), water (1 tbsp), cooking wine (0.50 tsp), sugar (0.50 tsp)</li>
            <li>Drain the meat from the water bath, squeeze out the excess water.

                Add the meat into the marinade and mix until the meat is fully coated in the marinade and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Prepare the rice noodles (0.50 lb) by separating the noodles if you see them stuck together. When you take them out for cooking, microwave them for a minute before stir-frying.</li>
            <li>Create chow fun sauce: In a small bowl, mix tamari (0.50 tsp), soy sauce (0.50 tbsp), and oyster sauce. Once mixed, set it aside.</li>
            <li>Add cooking oil (0.50 tbsp) to the marinated beef to seal the juices in the beef.

                Heat up the wok to the highest heat for about 1 minute and a half before adding more cooking oil (1.5 tbsp).
                
                Heat the oil for 30 seconds or until the oil starts to ripple.

                Add your beef and cook for 40-60 seconds on high heat. It's fine if it's a little red because we will continue to cook it later.
                
                Remove the beef from the wok and set it aside. You can strain the meat from excess oil at this time.</li>
            <li>Wipe down the wok before cooking the other ingredients.

                Add a small amount of oil to the wok. You won't need a lot because the rice noodles already have some oil.
                
                Fry the yellow onion (0.25) and the white parts of the scallions for 20-30 seconds or until fragrant.
                
                Add the rice noodles (0.50 lb). Take your time stirring them because they will need some time to loosen up in the wok. If you over stir them, they can break.
            
                Cook the noodles for two minutes or until golden brown. Another way to know when they're ready is when you can smell them.</li>
            <li>Add the sauce and cook for 1 minute until the noodles are well coated in the sauce. At this point, if you feel that the noodles are not dark enough, you can add more dark soy sauce.

                Add the green parts of the scallion and bean sprouts.
                
                Cook for 30-45 seconds before adding in the beef.</li>
            <li>Add the beef and mix. Let everything cook together for 1 more minute. Turn off the heat and add the sesame oil (0.50 tsp).</li>
